Weather App - Homework Task Week 6

Description: The app receives a user input, either in the form of a city name or by user coordinates, and provides weather information for the relevant location. Weather information provided includes:
    - Temperature;
    - Weather icon indicating whether: sunny, cloudy, raining etc;
    - Humidity (in percentage);
    - Temperatuve (in degrees celcius);
    - Wind speed (in km/hr)
    - UV index (using conventional media graphic colour to indicate danger level)
    - five day forecast for the relevant location that provides:
        - date for the forecast
        - icon indicating whether: sunny, cloudy, raining etc;
        - temperature (in degrees celcius);
        - humidity

Usage: this is a basic app - user has the capacity to search via the search bar in top left corner, submit their search either by hitting enter or selecting the question icon, nominate to search using current coordinates using the compass icon, or empty the search history using the trash can icon. 

Once the user has submitted the query, either via city name or coordinates, the relevant weather information outlined above is generated for that location.
